This model is a **Multiple Linear Regression** I put together in a couple of days to sample the a few things:

1.	an alternative estimating method that leveraged our existing dataset and could be executed in a fraction of the time of our existing estimating methods
1.	the power of Python & R vs Excel
1.	the power of using MLR's as a modeling tool and the analysis tools that come with linear regressions to measure their quality/reliability
1.	the benfits/features of using RMarkdown for reproducible HTML reports
