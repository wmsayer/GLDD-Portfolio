# CSDModelR

This model was a Multiple Linear Regression model I put together in a couple of days. The purpose of this was to sample the a few things:

1)	an alternative estimating method that leveraged our existing dataset and could be executed in a fraction of the time of our existing methods
2)	the power of Python & R vs Excel
3)	the power of using MLR's as a modeling tool and the analysis tools that come with linear regressions to measure their quality/reliability
4)	the benfits/features of using reproducible HTML reports
