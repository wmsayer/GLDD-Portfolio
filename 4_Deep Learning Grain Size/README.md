# Deep Learning Grain Size

The goal of this project was to develop a neural network to classify the grain size of a sand sample based on an image. We already collected all the data required to execute this, all we needed to do was take pictures of our samples before sending them into the lab.

The memo in this folder is the what I sent out to provide our Site Engineers as a set of instructions on how to take the pictures and submit the data.
