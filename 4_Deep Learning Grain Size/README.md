# Deep Learning Grain Size

This was a project set with the goal of developing a neural network to classify the grain size of a sand sample based on an image. We already collected all the data required to execute this, all we needed to do was take pictures of our samples before sending them into the lab. The memo in this folder is the what I sent out to provide our Site Engineers with a set of instructions on how to take image and submit the data.
