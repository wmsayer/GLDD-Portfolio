# Spreadsheets

Here are some spreadsheets to sample my proficiency in Excel. I made these to streamline some processes at GLDD to cut down to amount of time required to perform these tasks.

## Parallel Flow Model

This spreadsheet streamlines the process of calculating the single-branch pipe system that is equivalent to a given n-branch pipe system with n-branches pumping in parallel.

## Disposal Area, Culvert, and Weir Box Design

This spreadsheet assists in streamlining the processes of designing disposal areas, culverts, and weir boxes.

This task was a little more difficult since the design process for disposal areas and culverts is an iterative process which requires engineering understanding of the relevant concepts. Therefore I was ***not able to complete*** this spreadsheet in my time at GLDD to make it completely user friendly/streamlined for those that aren't competent in these design processes.
