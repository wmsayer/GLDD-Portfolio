# Scripts and Packages

This was the main repository of scripts I was building at GLDD to eventually use as the basis for an API infrastructure.

I separated the different tasks/projects in their own packages. As I continued to develop and get involved with more projects I soon found a lot of "administrative" functions that I could abstract out into their own package.

There are some missing directories, CSV's, etc. that I have intentionally omitted for data privacy reasons.
